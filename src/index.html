            Senior Sistemas is one of the largest software companies in Brazil. 
            There I was helping on the development of new features for the ERP, using AngularJS and Metronic design. 
            I also have motivated my teammates to study and to build prototypes using new technologies,
            such as ES6, React, NodeJS and MongoDB.
